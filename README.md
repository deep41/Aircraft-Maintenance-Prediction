# Aircraft-Maintenance-Prediction
The notebook focuses on learning to build RNN and LSTM networks for a time series dataset, specifically aiming to predict engine failure within a specific cycle using sensory data. Rigorous cleaning and preprocessing steps have been applied to the NASA turbofan dataset to identify the variables that provide the most value.
